# Bank-Marketing


In the banking sector, direct marketing campaignS are a key method for

promoting financial products, particularly term deposits. These campaigns

rely heavily on phone calls to engage with potential customers. However,
 
predicting which clients will subscribe to a term deposit after a
  
marketing campaign remains a significant challenge. Customer decisions
  
are influenced by a variety of factors, including their demographics,
   
financial circumstances, and past interactions with the bank.


## Objective

To address this challenge, this project aims to develop a predictive

machine learning model using data from a Portuguese banking institution

The dataset, collected between May 2008 and November 2010, contains
 
detailed information from various direct marketing campaigns. It includes
 
attributes such as the customerâ€™s age, job, marital status, education
  
level, and financial history, as well as details about the marketing
  
efforts, such as the number and outcome of previous contacts.

With a dataset that encompasses over 41,000 observations and 20 features,

this project will focus on identifying patterns and trends to predict

whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit. By leveraging machine
 
learning algorithms, the goal is to improve the bank's ability to target
 
potential customers, optimize marketing resources, and increase campaign
  
success rates.

## Converting categorical data to numerical data using LabelEncoder

- The LabelEncoder class from scikit-learn is imported and initialized.
  
- The fit_transform() method is used to apply label encoding to each categorical column in the dataset. This converts the categorical values into numerical values
  
- The encoded columns are assigned back to the original dataframe.

## Printing the first 10 rows after encoding
